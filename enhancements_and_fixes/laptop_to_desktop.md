# Laptop to Desktop

An installation was cloned from a laptop drive to a desktop drive. One fix mentioned was to run this:

```sh
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
```

It's also a good idea to keep drivers up to date anyway.

This didn't really fix what I was going after, but the Journal errors weren't obstructive and I'm keeping this here as a reminder.
