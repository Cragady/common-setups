The setup will be mostly the same, with a few exceptions on maybe some of the plugins and where the config is stored.

Instead of having the initial `init.lua` in `~/.config/nvim`, the actual Windows path is as follows:

`~/AppData/Local/nvim`

I may or may not include more here as I keep modifying the Windows install.
