# Windows Overview

I mainly included these files for fun. There might be a snippit or two in this dir that would be nice for reference.

To have a sane CLI experience in Windows, you have to either:

* Have an insane .bashrc/.bash_alias/.bash_profile file
* Have an insane Env var setup in Windows
* Be better at Windows

I chose to have an insane .bashrc file. The best thing Windows did for general development was to add WSL. If you have to directly compile to machine code for a Windows executable, go grab an IDE I guess. Or do what I did and embrace madness. (Or grab a lang that has a portable virtual env (JVM)).

WSL > Git Bash terminal for Windows > Madness > other weird shells somehow on Windows > Powershell

I need to get better at Powershell.

Maybe something here will help? It's really just throwing mud at the wall and hoping art appears when on Windows and you don't use a Unix-like shell or WSL.

Maybe I'll include something a lot more useful here at some other time.
