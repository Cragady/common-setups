# Overview For Setups

This is not meant to cover all cases and problems you, (me, I, myself), will come across. This is meant to provide a generalized instruction set that you can follow that will get you anywhere between 90-100% of the way there. Hopefully things won't change in a way that will cause lots of issues. You've got this, you can figure out any whackyness that you can come across. If you can do that, I can provide some hopefully somewhat clear instructions.
