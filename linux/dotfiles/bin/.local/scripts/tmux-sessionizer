# WARNING: As the script stands now, if a tmux server is runing, and you are in
# a neovim instance outside of tmux, it will just create new windows on the
# latest session that was accessed. Error given if command is manually entered:
# `inappropriate ioctl for device`, which sort of makes sense, but I don't
# know enough about how neovim prints to the console with their magic to
# really know.
#
# NOTE: This script was changed from source to be able to be executed directly
# from the CLI without a tmux server active. This won't work from inside
# a neovim instance outside of a tmux session.
