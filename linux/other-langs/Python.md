# Python

Ubuntu comes with python already installed, but an important thing to note: don't mess with the global packages. Always use a virtual env to install packages when needed.

For some reasons, I have the following installed manually:

* python2
* python3-dev
* python3-pip
* python3-venv
* python3-virtualenv

Just install a higher version of python if you don't want to use the system's default version. There may be a python version manager like node's `nvm`, so that may be worth looking into.
